### Description

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>This project is a Rick And Morty app, using <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">Rick and Morty API</a>, the design of the app was also inspired in the api website (because i liked very much).<p>
<p>It was made for practice my skills in the front-end, the idea was to make a clean and basic app, but with very good and interesting code. Also, one nice thing i did in this project was to add conventional commit, to make this i used Commitlint, Husky and Commitizen.</p>

### Technologies

The following technologies were used in this project:

ReactJS, Typescript, ChakraUI, ReactQuery, React-Router-Dom and Vite.

This project helped me consolidate skills as theming, typed language, routing and practice more chakra and react-query.
